        <h3>Introduction to the book</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Kvothe, pronounced nearly the same as "quothe." Names are important as they tell you a great deal about a person. 
            I've had more names than anyone has a right to. The Adem call me Maedre. Which, depending on how it's spoken, can mean The Flame, 
            The Thunder, or The Broken Tree.
        </p>
        <p> "The Flame" is obvious if you've ever seen me. I have red hair, bright. If I had been born a couple of hundred years ago I would 
            probably have been burned as a demon. I keep it short but it's unruly. When left to its own devices, it sticks up and makes me look 
            as if I have been set afire.
        </p>
        <p>
            "The Thunder" I attribute to a strong baritone and a great deal of stage training at an early age.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            I've never thought of "The Broken Tree" as very significant. Although in retrospect, I suppose it could be considered at least 
            partially prophetic.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first mentor called me E'lir because I was clever and I knew it. My first real lover called me Dulator because she liked the 
            sound of it. I have been called Shadicar, Lightfinger, and Six-String. I have been called Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, 
            and Kvothe Kingkiller. I have earned those names. Bought and paid for them.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I was brought up as Kvothe. My father once told me it meant "to know."
        </p>
        <p>
            I have, of course, been called many other things. Most of them uncouth, although very few were unearned.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian 
            and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make 
            the minstrels weep.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            You may have heard of me.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            So begins the tale of Kvothe—from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a 
            crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. In these pages you 
            will come to know Kvothe as a notorious magician, an accomplished thief, a masterful musician, and an infamous assassin. But The Name 
            of the Wind is so much more—for the story it tells reveals the truth behind Kvothe's legend.
